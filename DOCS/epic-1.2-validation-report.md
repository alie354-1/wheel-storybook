## Story-by-Story Validation

### Story 1.2.1: Storybook Configuration

**Status: Completed & Validated**

- **Monorepo Integration:** The `.storybook/main.ts` file is correctly configured to discover stories across all packages (`../packages/*/src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx|mdx)`).
- **Essential Addons:** The `package.json` and `.storybook/main.ts` confirm the installation and configuration of all required addons:
    - `@storybook/addon-essentials`
    - `@storybook/addon-a11y`
    - `@storybook/addon-interactions`
    - `@storybook/addon-viewport`
    - `@storybook/addon-docs`
- **TypeScript Integration:** The `.storybook/main.ts` file includes the necessary `react-docgen-typescript` configuration.
- **Asset Handling:** The `staticDirs` property in `.storybook/main.ts` is correctly configured to serve static assets.

### Story 1.2.2: Workspace Context System

**Status: Completed & Validated**

- **Workspace Context Decorators:** A `WorkspaceDecorator.tsx` exists in the `.storybook/decorators` directory, providing a `WorkspaceProvider` and `ThemeProvider` to simulate different workspace environments.
- **Global Toolbar Controls:** The `.storybook/preview.ts` file correctly configures `globalTypes` to add a toolbar control for switching between the six workspace contexts (consultant, client, admin, expert, tool creator, founder).
- **Decorator Application:** The `decorators` export in `.storybook/preview.ts` correctly applies the `WorkspaceDecorator` to all stories.

### Story 1.2.3: Brand Integration

**Status: Completed & Validated**

- **Custom Storybook Theme:** A custom theme is defined in `.storybook/theme.js`, specifying brand colors, typography, and other UI elements that align with THE WHEEL's brand identity.
- **Brand Assets:** The theme references a brand logo (`/assets/logo.svg`), which is present in the `.storybook/static/assets` directory and correctly served by Storybook.
- **Brand Identity:** The custom theme sets the `brandTitle` and `brandUrl`, ensuring a professional and branded experience.
