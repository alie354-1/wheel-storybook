# Package Structure Migration Documentation

## Overview
This document covers the migration of THE WHEEL design system into a monorepo architecture as part of Epic 1.1, Story 1.1.1. The restructuring organizes the existing component library into distinct packages with clear boundaries and dependencies.

## Package Structure
The monorepo is organized into the following packages under the `packages/` directory:

- **packages/ui/** - Core UI components extracted from `src/components/ui/`
  - Contains buttons, inputs, cards, etc.
  - Base component interfaces and types
  - Component-specific styles and assets
- **packages/patterns/** - Common design patterns extracted from `src/components/common/`
  - Composite components
  - Reusable component combinations
- **packages/layouts/** - Layout components and systems extracted from `src/components/layout/`
  - Grid and spacing utilities
  - Responsive layout managers
- **packages/themes/** - Theming system
  - Theme provider and context
  - CSS variable management
  - Theme switching logic
  - Workspace-specific theme variations
- **packages/workspace/** - Workspace-specific components
  - Workspace context providers
  - Permission management components
  - Workspace-specific UI elements
- **packages/shared/** - Shared utilities and contexts
  - Shared TypeScript types
  - Common utilities and helpers
  - Shared contexts and hooks

## Migration Details
- **Preservation of Functionality**: All existing functionality has been preserved during migration with no breaking changes to component APIs, maintaining props and behaviors, theme system functionality, and real-time features.
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Strict TypeScript mode is maintained across all packages with proper type exports and no implicit any types.
- **Import Updates**: Relative imports have been updated to package imports throughout the codebase, fixing paths in components, tests, and potential Storybook stories.
- **Package Configuration**: Each package has a configured `package.json` with correct dependencies, peerDependencies, build scripts, metadata, and export configurations.

## Migration Guide
- **Component Movement**: Components have been relocated from their original directories (`src/components/ui/`, `src/components/common/`, `src/components/layout/`) to their respective packages.
- **Import Path Changes**: Developers should now import from package aliases (e.g., `@wheel/ui`) instead of relative paths.
- **Breaking Changes**: There are no breaking changes in this migration; existing code should work with updated import statements.
- **Development Setup**: Follow standard Nx monorepo development workflows with commands scoped to specific packages when needed.

## Documentation for Each Package
Each package directory contains a `README.md` (to be created if not already present) outlining:
- Package purpose and scope
- Installation instructions (internal usage within monorepo)
- Usage examples (to be detailed in Storybook)
- API documentation (to be expanded)
- Contributing guidelines (aligned with project standards)

This migration sets the foundation for scalable development, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainable growth of THE WHEEL design system.
