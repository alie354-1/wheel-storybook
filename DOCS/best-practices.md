˚# Best Practices

This document outlines best practices to follow for a smooth and efficient development process.

## 1. Component-Based Architecture
- **Practice**: Build the UI as a collection of small, reusable components.
- **Benefit**: This approach promotes code reuse, simplifies testing, and makes the codebase easier to maintain.
