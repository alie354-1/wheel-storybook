## Storybook CSS Processing and Rendering Issues

### Storybook Component Rendering - "No Preview" Error

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - July 15, 2025

**Error Manifestation**:
- Stories discovered and appeared in sidebar but failed to render when selected
- Displayed "No Preview" with no visible errors in browser console
- All components affected - both React and HTML stories

**Root Cause**: Missing CSS/PostCSS configuration at the root level prevented Storybook from processing Tailwind CSS directives

**Files Created/Modified**:
1. **Created `/postcss.config.cjs`**:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = require('./packages/ui/postcss.config.js');
   ```
   - Points to UI package's PostCSS configuration
   - Storybook requires PostCSS config at project root

2. **Created `/packages/ui/src/globals.css`**:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```
   - Contains Tailwind CSS directives
   - Provides base styles and resets

3. **Updated `/.storybook/preview-bare.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   import '../packages/ui/src/globals.css';
   ```
   - Added explicit import of global CSS file
   - Ensures styles are loaded before component rendering

**Key Learnings**:
- Storybook looks for PostCSS configuration at the root level, not in packages
- CSS processing failures can cause components to appear as "No Preview" without obvious errors
- Always check both JavaScript/TypeScript AND CSS build pipelines when troubleshooting rendering issues
- Start with minimal preview configuration to isolate issues

**Prevention Strategies Applied**:
- Create root-level PostCSS configuration that references package configs
- Explicitly import global CSS files in Storybook preview
- Use minimal preview configuration during troubleshooting
- Document CSS processing requirements for Storybook

**Verification**:
- Components now render successfully in Storybook
- No more "No Preview" errors
- CSS processing working correctly with Tailwind directives

**Date Resolved**: July 15, 2025
**Impact**: Zero breaking changes, restored full Storybook functionality
**Documentation**: Updated in `DOCS/storybook-issue-timeline-analysis.md`
