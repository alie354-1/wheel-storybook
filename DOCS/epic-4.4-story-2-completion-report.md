- ✅ Workspace context variations (consultant, client, admin, expert)
- ✅ Permission-based scenarios
- ✅ Read-only mode
- ✅ Comment with replies
- ✅ Resolved comments
- ✅ Comments with attachments and mentions
- ✅ Long thread scenarios
- ✅ Interactive demo

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Design**: Separated concerns with dedicated sub-components
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types
3. **Workspace Theming**: Context-aware styling system
4. **Permission System**: Granular access control
5. **Real-time Ready**: Event-driven architecture for live updates

### Performance Optimizations
- React.memo for comment items to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Callback memoization with useCallback
- Efficient filtering and sorting with useMemo
- Lazy loading support for large comment threads

### Accessibility Features
- ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for modal interactions
- High contrast support for workspace themes
- Semantic HTML structure

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly interaction areas
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
- Optimized typography scaling

## Integration Points

### Package Exports
Updated `packages/layouts/src/index.ts` to export:
- `CommentThread` component
- All related types and interfaces
- Workspace theming utilities

### Dependencies
- `@wheel/ui`: Button, Avatar, Badge, Icon components
- `@wheel/shared`: Utility functions and hooks
- React hooks: useState, useCallback, useMemo
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Workspace Context Support

### Theming System
Implemented workspace-specific themes for:
- **Consultant**: Purple primary (#8B5CF6)
- **Client**: Blue primary (#3B82F6)
- **Admin**: Red primary (#EF4444)
- **Expert**: Green primary (#10B981)
- **Tool Creator**: Orange primary (#F59E0B)
- **Founder**: Purple primary (#7C3AED)
- **Neutral**: Gray primary (#6B7280)

### Permission System
Granular permissions for:
- `comment:create` - Add new comments
- `comment:edit` - Edit own comments
- `comment:delete` - Delete comments
- `comment:resolve` - Mark comments as resolved
- `comment:react` - Add reactions
- `comment:reply` - Reply to comments

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Testing
- Component rendering tests
- User interaction testing (click, type, keyboard navigation)
- Permission-based behavior validation
- State management testing
- Callback function verification

### Integration Testing
- Comment thread workflow testing
- Real-time update simulation
- Workspace context switching
- Permission system integration
- API interaction mocking

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation flow
- Color contrast validation
- Focus management testing
- ARIA attribute verification

  comments={comments}
  parentId="project-123"
  parentType="project"
  currentUser={currentUser}
  context="consultant"
  onCommentAdd={handleCommentAdd}
  onCommentReply={handleCommentReply}
  permissions={['comment:create', 'comment:react']}
/>
```

### Advanced Configuration
```tsx
<CommentThread
  comments={comments}
  parentId="document-456"
  parentType="document"
  currentUser={currentUser}
  context="client"
  allowReplies={true}

  permissions={[
    'comment:create',
    'comment:edit',
    'comment:delete',
    'comment:resolve',
    'comment:react',
    'comment:reply'
