# Accessibility Guidelines

This document outlines the accessibility guidelines for the design system.

## General Principles

-   **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
-   **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
-   **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
-   **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Specific Guidelines

### Keyboard Navigation

All interactive components must be fully operable with a keyboard. This includes:

-   Tabbing through all interactive elements in a logical order.
-   Using the `Enter` and `Space` keys to activate buttons and other controls.
-   Using the arrow keys to navigate menus and other composite widgets.

### ARIA Attributes

Use ARIA attributes to provide additional information to assistive technologies. This includes:

-   `aria-label` for buttons and other controls that do not have a visible label.
-   `aria-describedby` to provide additional information about an element.
-   `role` to define the purpose of an element.

### Color Contrast

Ensure that all text has sufficient color contrast with its background. The recommended contrast ratio is at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

### Focus Management

Ensure that focus is managed correctly when opening and closing modals, menus, and other overlays. The focus should be trapped within the overlay while it is open, and returned to the previously focused element when it is closed.
