# Pitfalls to Avoid

This document outlines common pitfalls and how to avoid them to ensure a smoother development process.

## 1. Dependency Management
- **Pitfall**: Using a library without ensuring it is a dependency in `package.json`.
- **Avoidance**: Always verify that a library is listed in `package.json` before using it. If it is not, install it with `npm install <library-name>`.

## 2. TypeScript Configuration
- **Pitfall**: Creating files outside the `rootDir` specified in `tsconfig.json`.
- **Avoidance**: Be mindful of the `rootDir` configuration and ensure that all new source files are created within the correct directory.

## 3. Case Sensitivity
- **Pitfall**: Mismatching the casing of filenames and component names.
- **Avoidance**: Always use PascalCase for both filenames and component names to avoid case-sensitivity issues with the TypeScript compiler.

## 4. Third-Party Libraries
- **Pitfall**: Assuming the props of a third-party library without consulting the documentation.
- **Avoidance**: Always consult the documentation for third-party libraries to ensure you are using their props correctly.

## 5. Type-Safety
- **Pitfall**: Using a generic `any` type as a workaround for complex `ref` types.
- **Avoidance**: While sometimes necessary, this should be a last resort. First, try to find the correct type definition in the library's documentation or type declarations.

## 6. Dynamic Components
- **Pitfall**: Not correctly typing dynamic components, leading to JSX-related errors.
- **Avoidance**: When working with dynamic components, ensure that they are correctly typed to avoid JSX-related errors. Casting the component to a generic `ElementType` type can be a useful solution.

## 7. Prop Validation
- **Pitfall**: Passing invalid props to components based on their intended usage.
- **Avoidance**: Be careful to only pass valid props to components based on their intended usage. For example, do not pass a `name` prop to an `Icon` component when using a custom icon via the `as` prop.

## 8. Component Rendering
- **Pitfall**: Passing a rendered element to a prop that expects a component type.
- **Avoidance**: Ensure that props that expect a component type (e.g., the `as` prop of the `Icon` component) are passed a component type, not a rendered element.

## 9. Monorepo Configuration
- **Pitfall**: Incorrectly configuring `tsconfig.json` files in a monorepo.
- **Avoidance**: Ensure that `tsconfig.json` files in each package are configured correctly to work with the base `tsconfig.base.json` and that path aliases are used correctly.
- **Pitfall**: Not exporting types that are used in a component's public API.
- **Avoidance**: Ensure that all types used in a component's public API are exported from the component's module.

## 10. Zod Validation
- **Pitfall**: Using the wrong property to access validation errors from a `ZodError` object.
- **Avoidance**: Use the `issues` property to access validation errors from a `ZodError` object, not the `errors` property.

## 11. React
- **Pitfall**: Returning `null` from a component that is expected to return a `ReactElement`.
- **Avoidance**: Ensure that all components return a valid `ReactElement`. If a component should not render anything, return `null` or an empty fragment (`<></>`) but ensure the function signature allows for it.

## 12. Browser-Specific APIs
- **Pitfall**: Using NodeJS-specific APIs in a browser environment.
- **Avoidance**: Use browser-compatible APIs, such as `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` instead of `NodeJS.Timeout`.

## 13. Type-Safety
- **Pitfall**: Not ensuring that the types of props match the types expected by the components they are passed to.
- **Avoidance**: Ensure that the types of props match the types expected by the components they are passed to. For example, if a prop can be `null` or `undefined`, make sure the type definition reflects that.
- **Pitfall**: Not exporting types that are used in a component's public API.
- **Avoidance**: Ensure that all types used in a component's public API are exported from the component's module.
- **Pitfall**: Incorrect relative import paths.
- **Avoidance**: Be careful with relative import paths, especially when working in a monorepo.

## 14. Service Layer Type Safety (Service Adapter Lessons)
- **Pitfall**: Using enums or types without importing them first, leading to "Cannot find name" errors.
- **Avoidance**: Always verify that all required enums and types are properly imported before using them in service implementations. Check the import statements at the top of the file.
- **Pitfall**: Using untyped array operations that result in "Property does not exist on type 'unknown'" errors.
- **Avoidance**: Always provide explicit type annotations for array callback functions, especially in filter operations. Use `(item: TypeName) => boolean` instead of just `(item) => boolean`.
- **Pitfall**: Combining arrays from different sources without proper type assertions, causing return type inference issues.
- **Avoidance**: Use type assertions like `as TypeName[]` when combining arrays to ensure the return type matches the expected interface.
- **Pitfall**: Assuming TypeScript can infer complex return types from array operations.
- **Avoidance**: Be explicit about return types, especially when combining data from multiple sources or performing complex transformations.

## 15. Import Management Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting to import required dependencies when adding new functionality to existing services.
- **Avoidance**: When adding new features that reference enums, types, or functions, always check that the necessary imports are included.
- **Pitfall**: Using inconsistent import patterns across service files.
- **Avoidance**: Follow established import patterns in the codebase and group imports logically (external libraries, internal modules, types).
- **Pitfall**: Not verifying that imported modules actually export the expected items.
- **Avoidance**: Check the source module to ensure that the items you're trying to import are actually exported.

## 16. Array Operations and Data Manipulation
- **Pitfall**: Filtering arrays without proper type annotations, leading to type inference failures.
- **Avoidance**: Always provide explicit type annotations for array operations: `array.filter((item: TypeName) => condition)`.
- **Pitfall**: Combining arrays of the same logical type but different TypeScript types without assertions.
- **Avoidance**: Use type assertions when you know the combined result should be a specific type: `[...array1, ...array2] as TargetType[]`.
- **Pitfall**: Assuming TypeScript can automatically infer the correct type when merging data from different sources.
- **Avoidance**: Be explicit about types when working with data from multiple sources, especially when combining local and remote data.

## 17. React Import Omissions (Critical Runtime Error)
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting to import React in React components that use JSX syntax, leading to "ReferenceError: React is not defined" runtime errors.
- **Avoidance**: Always ensure React is properly imported in all React components: `import React, { ... } from 'react'`. This is especially critical when modifying existing components or creating new ones.
- **Pitfall**: Relying on automatic JSX transforms without explicit React imports in all build environments.
- **Avoidance**: Use explicit React imports to ensure compatibility across different build configurations, including Storybook and other development environments.
