# Storybook React Configuration Fixes Report

## Date: January 14, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. React Import Configuration
- **Problem**: "React isn't defined" errors preventing component rendering
- **Solution**: Enhanced Vite configuration in `.storybook/main.mjs`

## Fixes Applied

### Main Configuration Updates (.storybook/main.mjs)

1. **Added React Plugin Import**:
   ```javascript
   viteFinal: async (config) => {
     // Import the React plugin here
     const { default: react } = await import('@vitejs/plugin-react');
   ```

2. **Added React Plugin to Vite**:
   ```javascript
   // Add React plugin and inject React globally
   config.plugins = [
     react(),
     ...config.plugins || [],
   ```

3. **Enhanced React Injection**:
   - Custom plugin to inject React into story files
   - Ensures React is available globally for all components
   - Automatic JSX transform configured

4. **Optimized Dependencies**:
   - Added React packages to optimizeDeps.include
   - Configured esbuild for automatic JSX transform

## Additional Configuration Present

### Preview Configuration (.storybook/preview.ts)
- React is already made globally available
- Window.React assignment for backwards compatibility

### Story Files
- React imports and window.React workarounds already in place

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Theme Loading**:
   - Check if `.storybook/brand.css` is loading properly
   - Verify CSS variables are available

2. **Test Components**:
   - Navigate to Button component story
   - Check console for any remaining React errors
   - Verify theme colors appear

3. **Clear Cache**:
   - The cache has already been cleared with `rm -rf node_modules/.cache`
   - Storybook should now rebuild with proper configuration

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- React should be properly defined for all components
- No more "React isn't defined" errors
- Components should render correctly
- Theme colors should be visible (pending CSS verification)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if Storybook builds without errors
npm run storybook

# In browser console, verify React is available:
console.log(window.React)
