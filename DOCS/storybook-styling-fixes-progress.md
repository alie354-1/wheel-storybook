# Storybook Styling Fixes Progress

## Current Status

### Working ✅
1. Components render properly
2. Inline styles work (confirmed with InlineStyleTest)
3. Storybook loads without errors

### Not Working ❌
1. Tailwind classes are not being processed (StyledTest shows plain text)

## Root Cause Analysis

The project is using Tailwind CSS v4 alpha (`@tailwindcss/postcss` package) but with a v3-style configuration file. This might be causing the issue.

### Configuration Mismatch
- `packages/ui/postcss.config.js` uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` (v4 syntax)
- `tailwind.config.js` uses v3 syntax (module.exports, plugins array, etc.)
- The globals.css has proper Tailwind directives

## Investigation Path

1. Check if Tailwind v4 requires a different config format
2. Verify PostCSS is actually processing the CSS files
3. Check if Storybook is picking up the PostCSS config

## Next Fix

Need to verify PostCSS processing is working by checking the Storybook main.ts configuration.

## Important Notes
- DO NOT modify the preview.ts file structure
- The current setup with globals.css import is correct
- Only need to fix the PostCSS/Tailwind processing
