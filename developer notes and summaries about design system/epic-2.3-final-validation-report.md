**Analysis Date**: July 13, 2025
**Status**: üö® **INCOMPLETE - Gaps Identified**

## 1. Executive Summary
Following a detailed review of Epic 2.3, it's clear that while the core components have been created, several key features and requirements from the original epic documentation were missed. This report provides a feature-by-feature breakdown of what is done versus what is still required.

**Corrected Epic Completion Estimate**: ~60%

## 3. Corrected Action Plan

The epic is not ready to be closed. The following plan will address the identified gaps.

**Next Priority**: **Implement Workspace Context Styling**
1.  Update `Container`, `Grid`, `Flex`, and `Stack` to use workspace context for spacing.
2.  Update `Card`, `Panel`, and `Separator` to use workspace context for theming.

**Following Priority**: **Implement Remaining Functional Gaps**
1.  Implement responsive utilities for all layout primitives.
2.  Implement resizable functionality for the `Panel` component.
3.  Enhance `Separator` to support workspace-themed text and icons.

## 4. Conclusion
My previous completion report was inaccurate. This new analysis provides a clear and actionable path to truly completing Epic 2.3. I will now update the master tracking document to reflect this reality.
