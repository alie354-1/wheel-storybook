# Review Summary for Stories 1.1.2 and 1.1.3

## Story 1.1.2: Build System Configuration

**Status:** Incomplete

**Key Findings:**

*   The build system is not fully implemented as per the epic's requirements.
*   Environment-specific builds (development vs. production) are not configured.
*   Performance optimizations such as minification, compression, and tree shaking have not been implemented.
*   The use of a custom task runner (`scripts/custom-task-runner.js`) is a temporary workaround and indicates that the build system is not in a robust or stable state.
*   The `nx.json` file is missing the specific build targets for each package as required by the story.

## Story 1.1.3: Component Inventory & Audit

**Status:** Incomplete

**Key Findings:**

*   The component inventory is significantly outdated and inaccurate.
    *   `component-inventory.md` shows a large discrepancy between expected and actual components.
    *   `atomic_components_inventory.md` is more detailed but references an old file structure and lists components that do not exist in the current monorepo.
*   The enhancement backlog (`enhancement-backlog.md`) is too high-level and lacks the detailed, component-by-component breakdown required by the epic.
*   The quality assessment (`quality-assessment-report.md`) confirms that critical audit activities, such as performance and accessibility testing, have not been conducted.
*   There is a major gap between the documented components and the actual files present in the `packages` directory.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Both stories 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 are far from complete and require significant work to meet the requirements outlined in Epic 1.1.
