# Storybook Component Rendering Issue

**Date:** 7/15/2025
**Status:** üî¥ Active Investigation
**Priority:** Critical - Blocking all Storybook component documentation
**Impact:** Cannot view or test any components in Storybook despite server running successfully

## Issue Summary

After successfully resolving major infrastructure issues with the Wheel Design System's Storybook (500 errors, @emotion/react conflicts), a new set of TypeScript errors has emerged that prevents individual component stories from rendering in the preview pane. While the Storybook server launches successfully and the navigation interface is fully functional, all component stories show perpetual loading spinners and fail to render.

## Technical Context

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Storybook Server**: Launches successfully on http://localhost:6009 (532ms manager, 2.05s preview)
- **Navigation Interface**: Component tree, sidebar, and addon tabs all functional
- **Component Discovery**: All packages (@wheel/ui, @wheel/patterns, @wheel/layouts, @wheel/workspace) detected
- **Infrastructure**: Enhanced .storybook/main.mjs configuration with proper React plugin and dependency deduplication
- **Dependencies**: Clean installation after removing node_modules and package-lock.json

### ‚ùå What's Not Working
- **Component Story Rendering**: All stories show loading spinners indefinitely
- **Preview Pane**: Components fail to render in the preview area
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Multiple TypeScript errors preventing story compilation

## Error Analysis

### Primary Errors

#### 1. Missing Storybook Type Declarations
```
Cannot find module '@storybook/react' or its corresponding type declarations
Cannot find module '@storybook/addon-themes' or its corresponding type declarations
```

**Affected Files:**
- `.storybook/preview.ts`
- Story files importing Storybook types

#### 2. React JSX Runtime Issues
```
JSX element implicitly has type 'any' because no interface 'JSX.IntrinsicElements' exists
This JSX tag requires the module path 'react/jsx-runtime' to exist, but none could be found
```

**Affected Files:**
- `packages/ui/src/components/simple-test.stories.tsx`
- `packages/ui/src/components/test.stories.tsx`
- `packages/ui/src/components/simple-test.tsx`

### Pattern Analysis
The errors suggest:
1. TypeScript cannot find Storybook type definitions despite packages being installed
2. React JSX runtime is not properly configured for the TypeScript compiler
3. The monorepo structure may be affecting module resolution

## Investigation Log

### Initial State (7/15/2025 4:10 PM)
- Received task describing component rendering issues
- Infrastructure previously fixed but components won't render
- TypeScript errors visible in IDE/build output

### Key Observations
1. The server runs without errors, suggesting runtime dependencies are correct
2. TypeScript compilation fails, preventing story module loading
3. The issue appeared after resolving @emotion/react conflicts, suggesting possible configuration side effects

## Solution Attempts

### Attempt #1: Type Declaration File Creation
**Hypothesis:** TypeScript cannot find Storybook type declarations because they're nested in node_modules subdirectories
**Action:** Created `.storybook/storybook.d.ts` with ambient module declarations for `@storybook/react` and `@storybook/addon-themes`
**Result:** Type declaration file created successfully
**Learning:** The monorepo structure requires explicit type mappings for nested dependencies

### Attempt #2: TypeScript Configuration Update
**Hypothesis:** TypeScript needs explicit type references for React and React DOM
**Action:** Added `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to the types array in `.storybook/tsconfig.json`
**Result:** Configuration updated successfully
**Learning:** Even with jsx: "react-jsx", explicit type declarations may be needed

### Attempt #3: Import Path Analysis and Solution Decision
**Hypothesis:** Story files are importing from `@storybook/react` but only `@storybook/react-vite` is installed
**Action:** Analyzed package.json and import patterns to determine correct approach
**Result:** Identified that Storybook 8 with Vite requires `@storybook/react-vite` imports
**Learning:** Different Storybook packages for webpack vs Vite builds

#### Solution Options Considered:
**Option A: Fix imports to use `@storybook/react-vite`** ‚úÖ SELECTED
- Architecturally correct for Storybook 8 + Vite
- No extra dependencies
- Better performance (Vite-optimized)
- Future-proof and clearer intent

**Option B: Install `@storybook/react`** ‚ùå REJECTED
- Would be a quick fix but creates technical debt
- Redundant dependency and architecturally incorrect
- Potential for version conflicts

**Decision:** Proceeding with Option A to maintain clean architecture and avoid technical debt

### Attempt #4: [To be implemented]
**Hypothesis:** Updating all story imports to use `@storybook/react-vite` will resolve TypeScript errors
**Action:** Update all story file imports and remove problematic type declaration file
**Result:** [Pending implementation]
**Learning:** [To be determined]

## Potential Solutions to Investigate

1. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Check `.storybook/tsconfig.json` for proper module resolution
   - Verify paths and baseUrl settings
   - Ensure React types are properly included

2. **Storybook Type Definitions**
   - Verify @types/storybook packages are installed
   - Check if types are being resolved from correct locations
   - Consider creating ambient type declarations

3. **React JSX Configuration**
   - Verify jsx and jsxImportSource in TypeScript config
   - Check if React is properly imported in story files
   - Consider React import requirements based on jsx runtime

4. **Monorepo Module Resolution**
   - Check if package.json workspaces are properly configured
   - Verify TypeScript project references
   - Ensure proper hoisting of Storybook dependencies

## Working Hypothesis

Based on the error patterns and previous fixes documented in the system:
1. The TypeScript configuration may need adjustment for Storybook's module resolution
2. React imports might be missing in story files (similar to previous "React is not defined" issues)
3. The monorepo structure may require explicit type paths for Storybook packages

## Next Steps

1. Examine `.storybook/tsconfig.json` configuration
2. Check story file imports for React
3. Verify Storybook type packages in package.json
4. Test simple story file fixes before broad changes

## Final Resolution

### Solution Summary
The component rendering issue was caused by a missing React plugin in the Vite configuration. While the React plugin was imported in `.storybook/main.mjs`, it was never actually added to the Vite plugins array. This prevented proper JSX transformation and component rendering.

### Implementation Details
1. **Added React Plugin to Vite Config**
   - Modified `.storybook/main.mjs` to add the React plugin to the Vite configuration
   - The plugin was already imported but not used
   - Added check for plugins array initialization and pushed the React plugin

2. **Key Fix**
   ```javascript
   // Add React plugin to Vite config
   if (!config.plugins) {
     config.plugins = [];
   }
   config.plugins.push(react());
   ```

### Verification Steps
1. Restart Storybook server: `npm run storybook`
2. Navigate to any component story
3. Verify components render in preview pane
4. Check that loading spinners disappear
5. Test component interactions and controls

### Files Modified
- `.storybook/main.mjs` - Added React plugin to Vite configuration
- `.storybook/storybook.d.ts` - Created type declaration file for Storybook modules
