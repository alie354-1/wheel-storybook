/**
 * Centralized Icon Library
 *
 * This file re-exports all icons from lucide-react, providing a single
 * source of truth for all icons used in the design system. This approach
 * allows for easier management, extension, and overriding of icons in the future.
 *
 * To add a new icon, simply import it from lucide-react and export it here.
 * To override an existing icon, you can define a custom component and export
 * it with the same name.
