# Epic 3.4: Error Handling Molecules

This epic contains a suite of components for comprehensive error handling, recovery, and user communication.

## Story 3.4.1: Error Boundary Components

### ErrorBoundary

The `ErrorBoundary` component is a fundamental building block for creating a resilient UI. It catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

**Implementation Guide**

Wrap the `ErrorBoundary` component around any part of your application that might throw an error.

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from './ErrorBoundary';
import { FallbackUI } from './FallbackUI';

const App = () => (
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={FallbackUI}>
    <MyComponent />
  </ErrorBoundary>
);
```

### Error Categorization

The `categorizeError` utility function provides a simple way to categorize errors based on their message. This can be extended to handle more complex error types.

### Error Reporting

The `errorReporter` service provides a simple way to report errors to an external service. By default, it logs errors to the console, but it can be configured to send errors to any error tracking service.
